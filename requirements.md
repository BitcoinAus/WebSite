“because if you can’t even clean up your own room, who the hell are you to give advice to the world?” Jordan Peterson 
 
It is incumbent upon Blockchain Australia to showcase what and how blockchain technologies can be used.  The website needs to encapsulate and reflect our core values.  If we don’t adopt this technology, then no one will. 
 
## Goals
1. Ambitous.
3. Attract and retrain new members.
4. Promote the technology through example not talk.  Show case what the technology can achieve and demonstrates our capabilities.
5. Seamless, ubiquitous and beautiful.
6. Colaborative with the community
7. Future proof through modern, modular, responsive technologies and be mobile friendly.  

## How 
These goals can be achieved by 

1. Create and use open source frameworks.
2. Using modern programming languages such as React, Angular or Websocket.
3. Adopting bootstrap v4 and then applying a ‘theme’ the site. 
4. Supporting the use of open source tech. 
5. Separating the front-end and back-end using a headless/API driven approach. 
6. Using letsencrypt.org for certificates and IPFS to cache content. 
7. Using Smart Contracts for business logic for members. 
8.  Taking payments via crypto using existing Bitcoin Brisbane tech. 
9. Use the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle. 
10. Providing ‘once-only' KYC to our members for use across all BA exchanges, driving participation by members and exchanges. 
11. Providing Blockchain notary services.
